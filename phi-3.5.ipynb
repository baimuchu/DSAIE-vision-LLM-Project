    "After summarizing, you must classify the image as defect types.\n",
    "While providing the summary, remember the following guidelines:\"\n",
    "1) Provide a general overview of the image that you see, describing important elements such image clarity, lighting conditions, type of pipe (concrete, PVC, ...), presence of water.\n",
    "2) Check for defects in the sewer pipes in the image.\n",
    "3) Pipes in good condition usually show a smooth, unbroken surface, no visible signs of damage like cracks or collapses, and an absence of blockages such as roots.\n",
    "4) On the other hand, you can have the following defects:\n",
    "4a)Cracks, Breaks, and Collapses (RB): Identify visible cracks along the pipe, instances where the pipe has fractured or completely broken apart, and areas where the pipe has collapsed.\n",
    "This includes longitudinal cracks, circumferential breaks, and complete structural failures that compromise the integrity of the sewer system.\n",
    "4b)Surface Damage (OB): Detect areas of the pipe's interior that exhibit signs of wear, erosion, or damage on the surface.\n",
    "This includes minor scratches, pitting, scaling, or any form of deterioration that affects the pipe's surface but does not necessarily penetrate deeply into the structure.\n",
    "4c) Production Error (PF): Identify defects that originated during the pipe's manufacturing process, such as inconsistent pipe thickness, improper joint alignment, or material imperfections.\n",
    "These are flaws that were introduced before installation and could potentially affect the pipe's performance or longevity.\n",
    "4d) Deformations (DE): Recognize any alterations in the shape of the pipe, such as bending, sagging, or bulging, that indicate a deformation.\n",
    "This includes both minor deformations that may affect flow efficiency and major deformations that threaten the pipe's structural integrity.\n",
    "4e) Roots (RO): Detect the presence of roots infiltrating the sewer pipe, whether through joints, cracks, or other vulnerabilities.\n",
    "This involves identifying both the initial stages of root intrusion and the more advanced stages where roots have significantly obstructed the pipe.\n",
    "5) Additional considerations while analyzing the images: do not consider blurred text or user-defined circled areas in the images.\n",
    "6) You will always try to describe the image that you see. Provide the output in JSON format as follows:\n",
